It is w orth noting that training the SVR to produce the com- ple x number g ( ยก ) = (cos ( ยก ) ; sin ( ยก )) of the angle results in a better performance than simply training it to output ยก . We sus- pect that this is because
the relation from the pose angle to the image feature locations is essentially trigonometric.

* add vertical visualization
* add degree display
* remove binary classification code?
* write training results to txt
* add cmd parameters for svm
* add feature parameter, e.g. enable hog
* add heuristic supression option
